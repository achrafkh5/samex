## 📊 **Calculation Logic**

### B2B Formula:
```javascript
const paidToBusiness = buyingCosts * 0.044; // 4.4%
const alcocaRevenue = buyingCosts * 0.044; // 4.4%
const totalCost = buyingCosts + papersFees + transportFees - paidToBusiness;
const netProfit = alcocaRevenue - (papersFees + transportFees);
```

### B2C Algeria Formula:
```javascript
const alcocaRevenue = buyingCosts * 0.088; // 8.8%
const totalCost = auctionFees + transportFees + buyingCosts + transactionFees + papersFees;
const netProfit = sellingPrice - totalCost + alcocaRevenue;
```

### B2C Korea Formula:
```javascript
const alcocaRevenue = buyingCosts * 0.088; // 8.8%
const totalCost = auctionFees + transportFees + buyingCosts + papersFees;
const netProfit = sellingPrice - totalCost + alcocaRevenue;
```
