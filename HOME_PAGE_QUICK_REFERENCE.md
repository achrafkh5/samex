## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Max 4 pinned cars** - System prevents more
- Cars need `createdAt` field to appear in recent section
- Brand logos must be uploaded in Admin → Brands
- Images can be in `image` (single) or `images` (array) fields

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Brands not showing?**
- Check if brands exist in database
- Verify brand logos are uploaded

**Popular cars empty?**
- Pin some cars from admin panel
- Check `isPinned: true` in database

**Recent cars not showing?**
- Ensure cars have `createdAt` field
- Add missing field to existing cars

**Brand filter not working?**
- Check URL has `?brand=` parameter
- Verify brand name matches exactly
